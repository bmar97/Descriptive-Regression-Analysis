### Introduction 
- In the realm of health research, age and Body Mass Index (BMI) are pivotal markers, each playing unique roles in offering insights into an individualâ€™s well-being. This descriptive analysis explores the relationship between age and BMI, while considering a range of demographic and lifestyle variables as operationalized indicators. BMI serves as a widely-used metric for assessing body composition, reflecting the balance between weight and height and providing insights into potential health risks, such as obesity-related conditions. By understanding how age interacts with factors such as dietary habits and physical activity levels, this study aims to elucidate patterns and trends in BMI across different population groups, capturing some of the diversity and complexity inherent in human health. Understanding these relationships can contribute to public health discourse, aid in/serve as a starting point for informing evidence-based strategies for health promotion and disease prevention across the lifespan. This leads us to the following research question, which we aim to address in this study:
'What is the relationship between age and BMI, while taking into account other demographic and lifestyle factors?'
